# 🗺️ Antigravity Architect Roadmap

## 🌟 The Vision: "The Living Development Environment"

Antigravity Architect aims to be the definitive standard for **Agent-First** infrastructure. Our goal is to move beyond static scaffolding and create repositories that "breathe"—sharing context, self-correcting through audits, and evolving alongside the AI agents that inhabit them.

## 📅 Timeline & Milestones

### ✅ Completed (v1.6.2 "The Living Repos")

*Focus: Security, Self-Healing, and Semantic Intelligence.*

- [x] **The Documentation "Genie"**:
  - Automatic generation of `TECH_STACK.md` during assimilation.
  - Deep-dive technical debt tracking and architectural manifests.
- [x] **Multi-Repo Context Bridge**:
  - Automatic discovery and linking of sibling repositories via `context/links.md`.
  - Rule sharing protocols for cross-project architectural consistency.
- [x] **Sentinel Mode (Self-Protecting Repositories)**:
  - Background monitoring (scripts/sentinel.py) of critical security files.
  - Automatic `/doctor` audit triggers on unauthorized modifications.
- [x] **Autonomous Evolution (Refactoring Protocol)**:
  - Incremental background refactoring ledger (`.agent/memory/evolution.md`).
  - Rule-governed transformation of legacy patterns to modern standards.

### ✅ Completed (v1.7.0 "The Community Marketplace")

*Focus: Ecosystem expansion and developer experience.*

- [x] **Community Blueprint Marketplace**:
  - Expanded the `--blueprint` flag with built-in stacks (Next.js 15, FastAPI, Go-Fiber, Rust-Axum).
  - Support for custom external blueprint URLs (e.g., `--blueprint https://github.com/org/blueprint`).
  - Added `--list-blueprints` for easier discovery.
- [x] **Core Refactoring & Optimization**:
  - Reduced cognitive complexity of project generation logic.
  - Standardized error handling and linting compliance.

### 🚀 Phase 1: Ecosystem Expansion (v1.7 - v1.8)

*Focus: Breadth of support and developer experience.*

- [ ] **Docker-Compose Orchestration**:
  - Auto-generation of multi-container `docker-compose.yml` based on detected infrastructure keywords (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ).
- [ ] **Enhanced Skill Bridge**:
  - Add native skills for **Docker management**, **Cloud deployment (Terraform/Pulse)**, and **Internal API exploration**.

### 🤖 Phase 2: The Agent Protocol (v2.0 "The Brain Stem")

*Focus: Deepening the AI-to-Code interface.*

- [ ] **Standardized Agent API**:
  - Formalize the `.agent/` directory into a machine-readable protocol that any LLM (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4) can follow with zero ambiguity.
- [ ] **Interactive Doctor GUI**:
  - A lightweight, single-file web dashboard (built-in) to visualize the "Doctor" reports, security audits, and project health.
- [ ] **Predictive Scaffolding**:
  - Use local LLM integration (via Ollama or Gemini Nano) to analyze the "Brain Dump" more deeply and generate partial implementation code immediately.

### 🌌 Phase 3: Total Autonomy (v3.0+)

*Focus: Zero-knowledge handovers.*

- [ ] **Zero-Knowledge Workspace Handoff**:
  - A mechanism to "package" the entire Agent Brain, memory, and context into a single tamper-proof snapshot for seamless handoff between different AI teams or models.

## 🛠️ Long-Term Technical Goals

| Target | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Portability** | Maintain the "Single File" rule for the core script, regardless of feature density. |
| **Speed** | Sub-second generation of standard projects through optimized template injection. |
| **Intelligence** | Move from keyword-based detection to semantic understanding of project goals. |
| **Compliance** | Integrate automated SOC2/HIPAA compliance checklists into the "Medical" and "Enterprise" blueprints. |
