# 🏗️ Antigravity Architect (Master Edition)

> [!CAUTION]
> **DISCLAIMER**
>
> This project and its code were created using artificial intelligence (AI) tools. If you have any concerns about the content or accuracy of this project, I recommend exploring alternative resources.
>
> The development process for this project involves several key steps:
>
> * We begin by working within [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) with local models.
> * Next, we create a new project base using [Antigravity-Architect](https://github.com/pkeffect/antigravity-architect) script.
> * The [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) project is then integrated into the Agentic Framework.
> * Most of the code is written using Gemini models.
>
> If significant issues or problems arise that cannot be resolved by Gemini, I will switch to a Claude model for assistance. Once those issues are addressed, we'll return to working with Gemini.
>
> Upon completion of the project, an audit is done with Gemini. Next, a thorough audit is conducted using a Claude model. If any remaining issues need attention, I may employ Claude again to resolve them. The results of this audit are then compared with the previous review by Gemini and any necessary adjustments made before finalizing the project.
>
> For future development and major releases, we will repeat this process to ensure continued quality and accuracy.
>
> Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!

**[Antigravity Architect](https://github.com/pkeffect/antigravity-architect)** is the definitive "Agent-First" project engine. It is a single-file, zero-dependency powerhouse that constructs **Living Repositories** designed to protect, evolve, and describe themselves to AI Agents (Gemini, Claude, GPT).

## 🌟 The Vision: "The Living Development Environment"

Modern software isn't just written by humans anymore. [Antigravity Architect](https://github.com/pkeffect/antigravity-architect) aims to move beyond static scaffolding and create repositories that "breathe"—sharing context across sibling projects, self-correcting through automated audits, and evolving alongside the AI agents that inhabit them.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Generate a professional, agent-ready repository in seconds.

### 1. Interactive Mode (Zero Config)

```bash
# No dependencies required - just Python 3.10+
python antigravity_master_setup.py
```

### 2. CLI Power User (One-Liner)

```bash
python antigravity_master_setup.py --name my-project --stack python,react,docker --blueprint fastapi --license mit
```

### 3. Initialize the Agent

Open the generated folder in your favorite AI-ready IDE (Project IDX, Cursor, or VS Code with Gemini Code Assist) and type:

> "Read BOOTSTRAP_INSTRUCTIONS.md and start."

## 💎 The Living Repository Ecosystem

[Antigravity Architect](https://github.com/pkeffect/antigravity-architect) isn't just a boilerplate generator; it builds an infrastructure that supports the entire development lifecycle.

### 🛡️ Sentinel Mode (Self-Protection)

The Architect generates `scripts/sentinel.py`, a background guardian that monitors security-critical files (like `.env`, rules, and core configs). Any unauthorized modification triggers an immediate `/doctor` audit, ensuring your repository remains hardened.

### 🧬 Autonomous Evolution

Repositories generated by the Architect include an `evolution.md` ledger. This allows AI agents to track and execute background refactoring tasks incrementally, bringing legacy code into compliance with modern architectural rules without human supervision.

### 🧠 Brain Dump Assimilation

Import massive, unstructured specifications. The **Assimilator** intelligently parses your input, classifying content into Rules, Workflows, or Documentation. It even detects tech stack aliases (e.g., recognizing SvelteKit as a Node environment).

### 🧞 The Documentation Genie

During generation, the Architect creates a deep-dive `docs/TECH_STACK.md`. This isn't a simple list; it's an architectural manifest that tracks technical debt, contextual observations (API surfaces, security needs), and agent interaction maps.

### 🌉 Multi-Repo Context Bridge

Working on a microservice or multi-repo architecture? The Architect automatically discovers sibling projects in your workspace, creating a `context/links.md` bridge that allows your AI agent to maintain architectural consistency across the entire ecosystem.

## 🏗️ Core Features

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Persona Orchestra

Pre-configured directives for specialized AI roles:

* **Architect Persona**: Focuses on SoC, SOLID, and DRY principles.
* **UX Specialist**: Enforces accessibility (a11y) and intuitive design.
* **Security Hardening**: Conducts deep audits for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
* **Model Dispatch Protocol**: Automatically detects when a task requires Tier 3 reasoning (Opus/Ultra) and prompts for a handoff.

### 🏗️ Community Blueprint Marketplace

Use the `--blueprint` flag to instantly scaffold specialized stacks. Now with **Remote Fetching** support!

#### Built-in Templates

* **Next.js**: Modern App Router (v15), Tailwind, and component architecture.
* **FastAPI**: Hardened models, endpoints, and Pydantic validation.
* **Go-Fiber**: High-performance Go web server structure.
* **Rust-Axum**: Type-safe, async Rust API backend.
* **Audio/DSP**: Specialized math/science directories (numpy/scipy).
* **Standard**: The classic universal Agent-First structure.

#### Remote Blueprints

Fetch any community-maintained blueprint directly from Git:

```bash
python antigravity_master_setup.py --blueprint https://github.com/user/my-blueprint
```

### 💾 CLI Presets

Save your favorite configurations for instant reuse:

```bash
# Save a preset
python antigravity_master_setup.py --save-preset my-stack --stack python,react --blueprint fastapi

# Load a preset
python antigravity_master_setup.py --preset my-stack
```

### ☁️ Cross-Platform Cloud Configs

Native support for modern development environments:

* **Google Project IDX**: Generates `.idx/dev.nix`.
* **VS Code / GitHub Codespaces**: Generates `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
* **Gitea**: First-class support with `.gitea/` workflows and issue templates.

### 🛡️ Production Engineering Standards

* **The "Git Ghost"**: Ensures empty directories are tracked via `.gitkeep`.
* **Professional Docs**: Auto-generates `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AUDIT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
* **Safe Update Mode**: Offers to **Update** (safely inject agent files) or **Overwrite** existing projects.
* **Privacy by Default**: Automatically hides `.agent/` and `context/` from Git to protect your "Agent Brain".

## 🤖 The Agent Protocol (`.agent/`)

The heart of every generated project is the machine-readable `.agent/` directory:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **rules/** | Hard directives injected into the AI's System Prompt. |
| **workflows/** | Slash commands (e.g., `/plan`, `/bootstrap`, `/review`) for standard tasks. |
| **skills/** | Tool definitions and standardized execution wrappers. |
| **memory/** | Session persistence via `scratchpad.md` (active work) and `graveyard.md` (rejected paths). |
